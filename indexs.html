scientific journals her work had appeared in.was a will thumbed copy of<i>On The Road.</i> it had been Molly's favourite book since collage. and the longer she <br/>
spent in these four walls the more the more she felt she needed to be free.</b></p>

<br/>
<p><b>she had spent the last ten years in this room. sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that"Work is the refuge of people who have <br/>
nothig better to do".Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama DNA. to be an outstanding achivement. Molly<br/>
<i>did </i>think she had something better to do.</b></p>
